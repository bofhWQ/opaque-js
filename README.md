# OPAQUE

this repo (will) house a JavaScript implementation of the OPAQUE password authentication key exchange (PAKE) protocol.

**WARNING: this project is a work in progress and should not be used for anything. Even after it's done it should not be used for anything because it has not been reviewed/audited for mistakes. This implementation was created out of interest in the protocol.**
